Use the Sign-In endpoint to obtain a bearer token.   * open the 'authorize' of the swagger and paste the bearer-token here   * note: the authorization is persisted in the swagger but eventually the token will expire 2. Use the user/me/companies endpoint to find out which company_ids are associated with the account 3. Validate by using, for example, the Companies endpoint (GET)   * fill the company-id ### Upgrade guide * v1.6.0   * Adds the plant-tags endpoints, for attaching and detaching tags * v2.0.0   * Attaching tags and companies during plant creation or updating is no longer supported.
